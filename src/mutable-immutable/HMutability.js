// Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler
// application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced
// memoization and change detection techniques with simple logic.
// Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures
// including: List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record
// Immutable.js also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient
// chaining of collection methods like map and filter without
// creating intermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat.
